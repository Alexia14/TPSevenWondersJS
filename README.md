# Welcome in a practical work based on Seven Wonders!


For this project we had to implement a game based on Seven Wonders in node JS.

## Install the repository : 
  Clone the directory git :
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UKyz/TPSevenWondersJS
```

## Execute the game :
  Execute the file 'index.js' :
  
```bash
node index.js
```

## Execute the tests :
  This project is based on the TDD method. Every classes has a test file to test if the class is good as the test requiere it. The test can also show a bogue when the class is modified. [(See what's TDD is)][TDDWiki]

To execute test of divinity : "mocha ./tests/divinity-test".

To execute test of city : "mocha ./tests/city-test".

To execute test of unit : "mocha ./tests/unit-test".
